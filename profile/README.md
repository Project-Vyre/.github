# Welcome to Vyre

This organization contains software for Vyre's projects such as the website and our Minecraft modpacks. Stay tuned for more!

## Minecraft Modpack(s)
* Finality (1.18.2 variant) - [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/finality) | [Website](https://project-vyre.github.io/FinalityMC-web/) (work in progress because Jekyll theming is not cooperating with me)
* Finality (1.19.2 variant) - CurseForge | Website (work in progress.)

Below is some placeholder text from the template that I'm trying to figure out what would be best to put here. Edit: nevermind, it actually does not show up... well then.
